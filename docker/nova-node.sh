#  Nova Node: one-line VPS installer for the full Nova panel
#
#  Installs xray-core + the Nova node agent and wires them together so ONE
#  public port (443) serves both the admin panel and the tunnel:
#    - xray terminates TLS on :443 and dispatches by path
#        <wsPath>     -> the VLESS/VMess/Trojan tunnel inbounds (loopback)
#        everything else -> the agent's HTTP panel + browser dashboard
#  The agent is managed from the Nova app, a browser (https://<your-vps>), or
#  the built-in Telegram bot. Runs entirely on YOUR server; nothing is sent out.
#
#  Run on your own VPS (Debian/Ubuntu):
#     bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IRNova/Nova-Server/main/nova-node.sh)
#
#  Options (env vars):
#     NOVA_ADMIN_PASS=...   panel admin password (a random one is generated if unset)
#     NOVA_DOMAIN=...       a domain that points at this server (optional). Without
#                          one, the node uses the public IP with a self-signed cert
#                          and the app's "no domain" switch.
#     NOVA_PANEL_PATH=...   secret panel subpath (stealth). Unset = a random one is
#                          generated on a fresh install; "none" = panel at the root.
#     NOVA_PANEL_PORT=...   extra HTTPS port that serves only the panel (optional).
#     NOVA_NO_PROMPT=1      never ask questions (use env values / defaults).
#
#  Managed-node (fleet) mode: install a box that is driven from a main panel,
#  with no panel of its own. The main panel's "Add node" button prints the exact
#  one-liner, which sets:
#     NOVA_JOIN_URL=...     the main panel's address
#     NOVA_JOIN_TOKEN=...   a one-time join token from that panel
#  The node installs, registers itself with the main panel, and then locks its
#  own panel (a stub page, no sign-in). Everything else installs the same way.
